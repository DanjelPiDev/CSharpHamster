# C# Hamster

--- 

C# Hamster is an extended reinterpretation of the well-known  
[Java Hamster Model](https://www.java-hamster-modell.de/).  
The project originally started as a small **OOP tutorial**, but has since grown to include many more features.

Goal: Learn, experiment, and have fun with Unity + C#.

## Features

- Classic **Hamster grid gameplay** (move, turn, collect, drop...)
- **Inventory system** for items
- **Dialogue system** for NPCs
- **Enemy system** with simple AI
- **Trading mechanics** (NPC â†” player)
- Easily extendable for your own tutorials or mini-games
